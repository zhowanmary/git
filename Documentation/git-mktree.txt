NAME
----
git-mktree - Build a tree-object from formatted tree entries


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git mktree' [-z] [--missing] [--literally] [--batch] [--] [<tree-ish>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads entry information from stdin and creates a tree object from those entries.
The object name of the tree object built is written to the standard output.

OPTIONS
-------
-z::
	Input lines are separated with NUL rather than LF.

--missing::
	Allow missing objects.  The default behaviour (without this option)
	is to verify that each tree entry's hash identifies an existing
	object.  This option has no effect on the treatment of gitlink entries
	(aka "submodules") which are always allowed to be missing.

--literally::
	Create the tree from the tree entries provided to stdin in the order
	they are provided without performing additional sorting, deduplication,
	or path validation on them. This option is primarily useful for creating
	invalid tree objects to use in tests of how Git deals with various forms
	of tree corruption.

--batch::
	Allow building of more than one tree object before exiting.  Each
	tree is separated by a single blank line. The final newline is
	optional.  Note - if the `-z` option is used, lines are terminated
	with NUL.

<tree-ish>::
	If provided, the tree entries provided in stdin are added to this tree
	rather than a new empty one, replacing existing entries with identical
	names. Not compatible with `--literally`.

INPUT FORMAT
------------
Tree entries may be specified in any of the formats compatible with the
`--index-info` option to linkgit:git-update-index[1].

Entries may use full pathnames containing directory separators to specify
entries nested within one or more directories. These entries are inserted into
the appropriate tree in the base tree-ish if one exists. Otherwise, empty parent
trees are created to contain the entries.

An entry with a mode of "0" will remove an entry of the same name from the base
tree-ish. If no tree-ish argument is given, or the entry does not exist in that
tree, the entry is ignored.

The order of the tree entries is normalized by `mktree` so pre-sorting the input
by path is not required. Multiple entries provided with the same path are
deduplicated, with only the last one specified added to the tree.
